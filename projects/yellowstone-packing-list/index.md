Anyone else want to contribute their *essentials*? (Obviously I am traveling by car!!)

* A camelback... smaller is better around Yellowstone where you can constantly find water.

* A compass and at least a crude map.

* A bag of salty peanuts + m&ms and some energy bars with lots of calories.

* Powdered gatorade, since drinking too much water without getting some salt in the system can be extremely dangerous.

* Two empty water bottles and some iodine tabs. One bottle for cleaning water to put in the camelback and one for mixing gatorade (which NEVER goes in the camelback). I always mark the Gatorade bottle so I never end up accidentally dumping water in it that may have some powder left over into the camelback.

* A hat which covers the neck and ears, as neck and ear sunburn at 10,000+ feet happens fast and feels pretty lousy.

* Sunscreen

* A sweater for up on summits / ridges no matter how warm it feels in town.

* Bear spray

* matches in a sealed bag in case it rains like hell out of nowhere and I need to warm up quickly.

## Optional

- Binoculars
- Comfortable shoes/trainers
- Hiking poles
