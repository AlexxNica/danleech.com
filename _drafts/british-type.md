When I travel abroad the thing that usually feels most foreign to me is the typography. Stuff that sits in view wherever I look. Street signs, licence plates, transit maps, news media. It makes me appreciate the character and familiarity of the typefaces we have in Britain.

Curious about their origins, I looked into some of our most well-known typefaces. Here’s what I found.

## Transport

Transport was designed in 1963 by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert.

Henrik Kubel of A2/SW/HK[^1] and Margaret Calvert developed an updated version in 2012. You can see [New Transport](http://www.newtransport.co.uk) in use on [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk).
